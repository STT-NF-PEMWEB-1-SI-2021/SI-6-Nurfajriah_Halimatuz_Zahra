                <h4>The Visual Prince of TXT, Huening Kai!</h4>
                <p><b>TXT (Tomorrow X Together)</b> is the second boy group from <b>HYBE LABES</b> that just launched 
                    its debut in early 2019. This brother group of BTS consists of five equally charming 
                    members with stunning visuals. One of them is Huening Kai, whose real name is Kai Kamal Huening. 
                    You might have already guessed from his name, and that’s right, Huening Kai is the first Western 
                    member of Big Hit Entertainment. <b>Born in Honolulu, Hawaii, on August 14, 2002</b>, Huening Kai is one 
                    of the youngest TXT members. Having parents from two different countries makes him have foreign 
                    features and blessed him with a charming visual that resembles a prince.
                </p>
                
                <p>Rumors of Big Hit Entertainment debuting a new idol group have been around since early 2017. 
                    At the end of 2018, these rumors increased and made netizens speculate that the agency would 
                    debut a new boy group (since the GLAM scandal in 2016, Big Hit stopped accepting female trainees).

                    On January 9, 2019, these rumors were proven true when BigHit launched a website containing a 
                    countdown with the words “You & Me.” The agency then announced that they would debut a new boy group 
                    under the name <b>TOMORROW X TOGETHER (투모로우 바이 투게더)</b>, shortened as TXT. The meaning of the name 
                    is “to come together to realize the same dream to build a new tomorrow.” That’s why when they were 
                    introduced, they always said the phrase, “One Dream!”
                </p>

                <p>The day after the agency announced the name of its new boy group, they began to release the 
                    introductory videos of its members and began to attract the public and potential fans’ 
                    attention. On <b>January 16, 2019</b>, Big Hit Entertainment released an introductory video for 
                    TXT’s third member, Huening Kai, who is <b>the  agency’s first multiracial idol.</b> Only a few hours after 
                    he was introduced to the public, videos and photos of before his debut circulated widely on social media. 
                    The fans gathered evidence showing that since childhood, Kai was good at playing the guitar and piano.
